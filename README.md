# My First Project Simple Calculator  

This is my **very first** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project! 
I made it as a way to try out **everything I know so far** in web development.  
It’s simple, it has flaws, and that’s the point  it shows exactly where I was when I started.  

##  What it does
- A very basic calculator  
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
- Remembers your last calculation using `localStorage`  
- Styled with Google Fonts and my own CSS

##  Why I made it
I wanted to combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in one project and see if I could make something that actually works.  
This was me experimenting and applying what I’ve learned so far no frameworks, no fancy tools.

##  Tech I used
- **HTML** for the structure
- **CSS** for styling  
- **JavaScript** for functionality (yes, even `eval()` )  
- **localStorage** for saving the calculation

##  What I learned
- How to structure a basic HTML page  
- Adding styles with CSS  
- Writing functions in JavaScript  
- Saving and retrieving data with `localStorage`  
- The joy of seeing something you made actually work 

##  Disclaimer
This is a *beginner project*. It’s not perfect, and it’s not meant to be.  
I’ll look back on it later to see how much I’ve improved.
